          Functionality for fuzzy-selecting using selecta.
    Includes fuzzy-selecting files, buffers, and command history.

INTRODUCTION                                                 *selecta*

This plugin is a tool for fuzzy-selecting things in vim. Examples of
things you can fuzzy-select include files, buffers, and commands from
the history. This is all accomplished using the program `selecta`,
which can be found at https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta.

USAGE                                                  *selecta-usage*

all of the following to your `vimrc` file:

    " Find all files in all non-dot directories starting in the
    " working directory. Fuzzy select one of those. Open the selected
    " file with :e.
    nnoremap <leader>e :SelectaFile<cr>

    " Find all buffers that have been opened.
    " Fuzzy select one of those. Open the selected file with :b.
    nnoremap <leader>b :SelectaBuffer<cr>

    " Find previously run commands.
    " Fuzzy select one of those. Run that command with :
    nnoremap <leader>h :SelectaHistoryCommand<cr>
